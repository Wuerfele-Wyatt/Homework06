This project is for practicing XML tools.

This will be a very basic blackjack game written using XML. It will have a 5-deck shoe that will be refreshed upon every round. Dealer stands on 17. Only two options for the player will be to _Hit_ and _Stand_.
Winning pays out 2x. Blackjack pays 2.5x. If the dealer shows an Ace or face card they automaticaly check their reserve. Should that reserve give the dealer 21 the player automatically loses.
This game will not feature insurance, doubling down, or splitting... unless I'm feeling silly.
